# Variational-Principle-Project1

This is for project 1 of the module Variational Principle.
Here are two methods named by "Green" and "Matrix".
"Green" is using Green's function to find integration version of differential equation.
"Matrix" is using finite difference method.
We solve a simple expamle first to check the validity of these two methods
$$\nabla^2 f(x,y)=-f^2(x,y)$$
Then we use these two methods to solve equation
$$\nabla^2 f(x,y)=f(x,y)-\tanh^2(f(x,y))$$
and consider $f(x,y)$ vanishes on the boundary.
