# Variational-Principle-Project1
This is for project 1 of the module Variational Principle.
Here are two methods named by "Green" and "Matrix".
"Green" is using Green's function to find integration version of differential equation.
"Matrix" is using finite difference method.
We solve a simple expamle first
$$f_k$$
